# Internationalization & Accessibility Review

## Internationalization
- PWAs default to English; no locale switcher or translations present.
- Dates formatted via `date-fns` but use default locale; currency formatting hard-coded (`$`, `RWF`).
- No RTL support; layout uses flexbox but not tested for Arabic/Hebrew.
- Environment variables support regional defaults in OTP function (RW/EU), but UI lacks region awareness.

### Recommendations
1. Introduce `next-intl` or `@formatjs` with message catalogs for key routes.
2. Use ICU strings for pluralization (orders, promotions) and currency formatting via `Intl.NumberFormat`.
3. Add locale detection + toggle, store preference in Supabase profile.
4. Validate component library for RTL by adding Storybook stories with `dir="rtl"`.

## Accessibility
- Components sourced from `@icupa/ui` (Radix-based) with good base semantics.
- Lacks ARIA live regions for real-time order updates; no offline status indicator.
- Forms (OTP, onboarding) missing `aria-describedby` and error messaging.
- Keyboard navigation: menus use Radix so accessible, but analytics tables need caption/summary.
- No automated a11y CI step despite `vitest-axe` dependency.

### Recommendations
1. Add `pnpm test:accessibility` to CI and enforce zero violations.
2. Provide skip-links, focus outlines, and high-contrast theme options.
3. Add screen reader announcements for live updates and offline fallback.
4. Document WCAG 2.2 AA compliance plan, including audits for pharmacies (drug interactions) and travel (itinerary).
