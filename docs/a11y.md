# Accessibility and Responsive Audit

## Automated coverage
- ✅ `npm run test:accessibility` – axe suite for core diner surfaces passes with no WCAG 2.0 A/AA violations.
- ✅ Manual axe runs in browser devtools on the following routes identified no critical blockers: `/`, `/admin`, `/admin/tools/qr`, `/merchant`, `/merchant/receipts`, and the 404 surface.

## Screen-level follow-ups
### Global
- [ ] Introduce a skip-to-content link anchored to the new `Page` layout wrapper to improve keyboard ergonomics.
- [ ] Evaluate colour contrast of the aurora gradient on legacy displays; current tokens meet WCAG AA in testing, but we should capture a regression test before GA.

### Admin console (`/admin`)
- [ ] Annotate the observability link list with `aria-describedby` hints so screen readers get the context (“opens in new tab”).
- [ ] Ensure tab panels announce selection changes via `aria-live` or focus management when switching between “Onboarding”, “AI Settings”, etc.

### Admin QR tools (`/admin/tools/qr`)
- [ ] Expose status updates (loading, success, failure) via `aria-live="polite"` so non-visual users know when rotation finishes.
- [ ] Collapse the result card into a responsive grid for <360px widths; long QR payloads currently require horizontal scrolling.

### Merchant portal (`/merchant`)
- [ ] Validate voice-over order of the shell navigation; ensure the active section receives an `aria-current` marker.

### Merchant receipts (`/merchant/receipts`)
- [ ] Announce background refreshes via `aria-live` or toast region so screen-reader users know when new receipts arrive.
- [ ] Refine the card layout for XS viewports to avoid truncating fiscal IDs; consider a definition list pattern.

### Not found (`*`)
- [ ] Add a short description of available destinations or a search affordance for faster recovery.

> Track each TODO in the platform backlog before launch; they remain open until verified on the current staging preview.
