## Executive Summary

ICUPA cannot proceed to production until the following critical security and operational issues are resolved. This document tracks the **must-fix items** before go-live.

## Critical Blockers (S0)

### S0-001: High-Severity Dependency Vulnerabilities ❌

**Status:** Not Fixed  
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Blocks Production Deployment  
**Owner:** DevOps/Security  
**Due:** Before Staging Deployment  

**Issue:**
- Next.js 14.2.5 has CVE-2024-46982 (CVSS 7.5) - cache poisoning vulnerability
- Multiple other dependencies have known high-severity vulnerabilities
- esbuild, @supabase/auth-js, and others need updates

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ pnpm audit
# Shows 6+ high-severity advisories
```

**Impact:**
- Cache poisoning attacks possible
- Potential RCE vectors
- Data exposure risks

**Fix:**
1. Update Next.js to >=14.2.10
2. Update all dependencies with CVEs
3. Run `pnpm audit` until clean
4. Test thoroughly in staging

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `pnpm audit --audit-level=high` returns 0 vulnerabilities
- [ ] All dependencies updated to latest patch versions
- [ ] Staging deployment successful
- [ ] No regression in functionality

**Tracking:** Issue #TBD (create after this PR merges)

**Status:** FIXED in this PR  
**Solution:** Added `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` for automated security scanning

### ✅ S1-006: Missing SECURITY.md
**Status:** FIXED in this PR  
**Solution:** Added `SECURITY.md` with vulnerability reporting process

### ✅ S1-007: Missing SUPPORT.md and CODEOWNERS
**Status:** FIXED in this PR  
**Solution:** Added both files with comprehensive support and ownership definitions

### ✅ S1-008: No SBOM Generation in CI
**Status:** FIXED in this PR  
**Solution:** Added `.github/workflows/sbom.yml` to generate CycloneDX SBOMs

### ✅ S1-009: No Coverage Gate in CI
**Status:** FIXED in this PR  
**Solution:** Added `.github/workflows/coverage.yml` with 70% threshold

### ✅ S1-010: Missing Release Runbook
**Status:** FIXED in this PR  
**Solution:** Added `docs/release-runbook.md` with comprehensive procedures

## Risk Mitigation

### If S0-001 Cannot Be Fixed Before Deadline

**Option 1: Delay Production (Recommended)**
- Wait for dependency updates
- Ensure no security vulnerabilities
- Maintain quality standards

**Option 2: Compensating Controls (If Critical)**
- Deploy behind WAF with strict rules
- Implement rate limiting at infrastructure level
- Enhanced monitoring and alerting
- Rapid incident response team on standby
- Document risks with executive sign-off

**Option 3: Staged Rollout**
- Deploy to limited beta users
- Monitor closely for issues
- Gradual expansion as confidence grows

## Contact & Escalation

### Primary Contacts
- **DevOps Lead:** [Name/Email]
- **Security Lead:** [Name/Email]
- **Engineering Lead:** [Name/Email]

### Escalation Path
1. Notify engineering team via Slack
2. If not resolved in 2 hours: Escalate to CTO
3. If production-impacting: Immediate executive notification

## Next Actions

1. **Merge this PR** to deploy S1 fixes
2. **Create Issue #TBD** for S0-001 dependency updates
3. **Assign owner** to dependency update issue
4. **Set target date** for staging deployment
5. **Schedule** go/no-go meeting after staging validation

**Remember:** Quality and security are more important than speed. Better to delay launch than deploy with known vulnerabilities.
