# Phase 3 Lighthouse & Performance Notes

Summarise each Lighthouse run, WebPageTest trace, and Core Web Vitals snapshot here. Reference raw exports stored in `artifacts/phase3/lighthouse/` and link to any dashboards shared with stakeholders.

For each entry include:

- **Date / Build hash**
- **Environment & network conditions** (device preset, throttling, connection type)
- **Scores** (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO, PWA) with deltas vs. prior run
- **Key metrics** (LCP, TTI, CLS, FID/INP) and primary bottlenecks identified
- **Actions taken / recommended** with owners and due dates
- **Evidence** â€“ trace screenshots, JSON export names, or filmstrip links

Mark runs that meet or exceed the 90+ requirement and highlight any regressions requiring follow-up tickets.
