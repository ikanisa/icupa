# Phase 3 UX Evaluation Notes

Use this log to capture findings from diner field sessions, heuristic reviews, and install/offline checks. Each entry should reference supporting artefacts under `artifacts/phase3/ux-research/` or linked videos.

Template:

- **Date / Facilitator**
- **Devices & locales covered**
- **Journey focus** (browse → cart → pay placeholder, install prompt, offline recovery, push opt-in, AI chat placeholder)
- **Highlights** – positive behaviors worth amplifying
- **Issues** – severity rating (P0–P3), reproduction steps, proposed resolution/owner
- **Attachments** – filenames or URLs for exports, transcripts, or screenshots

Close the note with a summary of outstanding Linear tickets and whether additional sessions are required.
