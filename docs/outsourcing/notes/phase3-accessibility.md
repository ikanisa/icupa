# Phase 3 Accessibility Review Log

Use this log to capture audits, issues, and remediation steps identified during the outsourced accessibility review for Phase 3. Each entry should include:

- **Date & reviewer** – Who executed the sweep and when.
- **Surface** – Component or flow covered (e.g. Action Dock, AI chat, Payment Screen).
- **Findings** – List WCAG references, screenshots, and reproduction steps.
- **Remediation** – Owner, fix status, and linked pull requests.
- **Retest evidence** – Link to updated artefacts in `artifacts/phase3/accessibility/` once verified.

Append entries in reverse chronological order so the latest review is easiest to find. Close the log with a summary note once all findings are resolved and the Programme Lead has signed off Phase 3 accessibility.
