## Getting Help

### Documentation

Before asking for help, please check our documentation:

- **[Release Runbooks](docs/runbooks/)**: Deployment and operational procedures
- **[Testing Guide](docs/testing.md)**: Testing strategies and practices

### Common Issues

#### Build Issues

**Problem**: Build fails with `pnpm: command not found`
```bash
# Solution: Install pnpm globally
npm install -g pnpm@10
```

**Problem**: Build fails with missing environment variables
```bash
# Solution: Set required environment variables
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://test.supabase.co VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=test pnpm build
```

#### Development Issues

**Problem**: Supabase local development not working
```bash
# Solution: Make sure Docker is running, then:
supabase start
supabase db reset --local --yes
```

**Problem**: Lint errors in ecotrips apps
```text
# Note: These are pre-existing and can be ignored unless you're modifying those files
```

#### Test Issues

**Problem**: Tests fail with DB connection errors
```text
# Note: DB-dependent tests are automatically skipped if Supabase CLI is not available
# To run full tests, ensure Supabase is running locally
```
