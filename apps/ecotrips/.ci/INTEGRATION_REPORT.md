# Integration Report â€“ Local Workspace Audit

## Repository State
- Default branch detected locally: `work` (no remote configured; unable to verify upstream default).
- Remote branches: unavailable (repository has no `origin` remote in this environment).
- Candidate feature branches merged: none detected beyond current `work` history.

## Dependency Review Summary
- Generated detailed inventory of all tracked workspace `package.json` manifests in [.ci/DEPENDENCY_INVENTORY.md](DEPENDENCY_INVENTORY.md).
- Multiple applications pin critical runtime dependencies (e.g., Next.js, React, Supabase client). Recommend periodic review for security updates.
- Internal packages largely use `workspace:` or `file:` references ensuring local workspace resolution.
- Added automated mismatch detection so the report now highlights diverging Next.js, React, Supabase, TypeScript, and Node engine versions across workspaces.

## Testing & Tooling
- Comprehensive lint/typecheck/test suites were **not executed** because integration scope is documentation-only and remote branches were unavailable for merge validation.
- No lockfile regeneration performed; existing `package-lock.json` retained to preserve deterministic installs.

## Follow-up Recommendations
1. Configure repository remote access in the CI environment to enumerate upstream branches before attempting cross-branch reconciliation.
2. Once remotes are available, rerun the integration workflow to ensure all active branches are merged into the canonical default branch.
3. Execute `npm run test:ci` to validate fullstack health ahead of deployment pipelines (e.g., Vercel).

## Phased Task Navigation
- Detailed clickable task stubs are documented in [docs/PHASED_TASKS.md](../docs/PHASED_TASKS.md) for quick access to each follow-up action.
- Each phase now includes a "Suggested Tasks" roster with dedicated start links so release managers can launch the appropriate checklist in a single click.
- Added a visual "Phase Cards" gallery that mirrors the deployment workflow screenshot, pairing every start link with a suggested task view anchor for rapid execution.
- Introduced a `/phases` interactive control tower inside the Next.js app that mirrors these stubs, copies commands to the clipboard, and tracks status in-browser.
