### New: Interactive phase control tower

- Visit [`/phases`](../app/phases) in the Next.js app to launch the live checklist with clipboard-ready commands.
- Each task mirrors the stubs below and records an inline status (`Not started ‚Üí In progress ‚Üí Completed`).
- The **Start Task** buttons copy terminal commands automatically; the **Mark complete** button logs progress for reviewers.

## Issue 1: Remote inventory is missing, blocking a trustworthy integration baseline
<a id="issue-1-remote-inventory-is-missing-blocking-a-trustworthy-integration-baseline"></a>
[Start Task](#task-issue-1)

### Suggested Tasks
- Reconnect origin and capture authoritative branch inventory ‚Äî [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Task](#task-issue-1)
- Document remote configuration prerequisites for CI environments ‚Äî [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Task](#task-issue-1-prereqs)

### Task Steps
<a id="task-issue-1"></a>
:::task-stub{title="Reconnect origin and capture authoritative branch inventory"}
1. Run `git remote -v` and, if empty, add the canonical origin URL supplied by the team.
2. Execute the preflight commands from `SESSION_STATUS.md` to fetch all refs (`git fetch --all --prune --tags`) and detect the default branch.
3. Populate `.ci/branches.txt` and `.ci/ahead_behind.txt` using the `git branch -r` and `git for-each-ref` commands listed in the original runbook.
4. Record the results in `.ci/INTEGRATION_REPORT.md`, replacing the placeholder notes about missing remote access.:::

<a id="task-issue-1-prereqs"></a>
:::task-stub{title="Document remote configuration prerequisites"}
1. Capture the credentials or network requirements needed to reach the canonical origin (VPN, SSH keys, PAT scopes).
2. Record the steps in `SESSION_STATUS.md` under a new "Remote Access" subsection so teammates can reproduce the setup.
3. Cross-link the documentation from `.ci/INTEGRATION_REPORT.md` to highlight any blockers that remain.
4. Escalate unresolved access gaps to the release manager before attempting multi-branch integration.:::

## Issue 2: Dependency audit lacks actionable workspace coverage
<a id="issue-2-dependency-audit-lacks-actionable-workspace-coverage"></a>
[Start Task](#task-issue-2)

### Suggested Tasks
- Regenerate dependency inventory with workspace coverage ‚Äî [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Task](#task-issue-2)
- Annotate remediation items directly in the inventory report ‚Äî [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Task](#task-issue-2-remediation)

### Task Steps
<a id="task-issue-2"></a>
:::task-stub{title="Run and enhance dependency inventory across workspaces"}
1. Execute `node scripts/dependency-inventory.mjs` to regenerate `.ci/DEPENDENCY_INVENTORY.md`, ensuring all `apps/*`, `packages/*`, and `ops/*` manifests are captured.
2. Update the script to flag mismatched versions of shared dependencies and workspace-specific Node/Next.js requirements, emitting them under a ‚ÄúWarnings‚Äù section.
3. Cross-check the findings against `package.json` workspace definitions and document remediation items directly in the inventory report.:::

<a id="task-issue-2-remediation"></a>
:::task-stub{title="Document dependency remediation follow-up"}
1. Review the ‚ÄúWarnings‚Äù section emitted by the inventory script and group items by owning workspace or package.
2. For each warning, propose an action plan (upgrade, dedupe, replace) and add it as a checklist under the corresponding entry in `.ci/DEPENDENCY_INVENTORY.md`.
3. Share the remediation summary in `DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_REPORT.md` so deployment owners can schedule updates.
4. Track completion status using GitHub issues or the team‚Äôs project board, linking back to the inventory entry for context.:::

## Issue 3: Cross-branch reconciliation is still outstanding
<a id="issue-3-cross-branch-reconciliation-is-still-outstanding"></a>
[Start Task](#task-issue-3)

### Suggested Tasks
- Create the integration branch and merge active remotes ‚Äî [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Task](#task-issue-3)
- Capture conflict resolutions and policy deviations ‚Äî [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Task](#task-issue-3-conflicts)

### Task Steps
<a id="task-issue-3"></a>
:::task-stub{title="Create integration branch and merge active remotes"}
1. Create `integration/merge-all-branches-<date>` from `main` once it is freshly pulled.
2. For each candidate branch discovered in `.ci/branches.txt`, tag `pre-merge/<branch>/<timestamp>` and attempt a rebase onto the integration branch, falling back to merges per policy.
3. Resolve conflicts following `AGENTS.md` guidance (env files, dependency manifests, lockfiles).
4. After integrating all branches, regenerate `package-lock.json`, run `npm run test:ci`, and commit the results with the templated message.:::

<a id="task-issue-3-conflicts"></a>
:::task-stub{title="Log conflict outcomes and policy exceptions"}
1. After each merge or rebase, record files that required manual attention in `.ci/INTEGRATION_REPORT.md` under a new "Conflict Log" heading.
2. Highlight any deviations from the prescribed conflict resolution policies (e.g., when neither side could be preserved without refactoring).
3. Tag the original branch authors using `git shortlog -sne -- <path>` to assign follow-up reviews on contentious sections.
4. Attach diffs or screenshots if binary assets were duplicated to satisfy the policy.:::

<a id="issue-4-deployment-readiness-for-vercel-has-not-been-validated"></a>
[Start Task](#task-issue-4)

### Suggested Tasks
- Verify Vercel preview deployment pipeline ‚Äî [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Task](#task-issue-4)
- Prepare environment variable audit for Vercel projects ‚Äî [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Task](#task-issue-4-env-audit)

### Task Steps
<a id="task-issue-4"></a>
:::task-stub{title="Verify Vercel deployment pipeline after integration"}
1. Ensure Next.js apps in `app/` or `apps/*` build successfully with `npm run build --workspace <app>`.
2. Update `.vercel/project.json` or equivalent (if present) with the new integration branch and environment variables required by Supabase per `.env.example`.
3. Trigger a preview deployment via Vercel CLI or dashboard, capturing logs for inclusion in the updated integration report.
4. Document the deployment verification steps and outcomes in `DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_REPORT.md`.:::

> üí° If Turbopack crashes during the build, capture the automatically generated webpack fallback logs from `app/scripts/run-next-build.mjs` and attach them to the report for reviewers.

<a id="task-issue-4-env-audit"></a>
:::task-stub{title="Audit Vercel environment configuration"}
1. Enumerate required Supabase, authentication, and analytics environment variables from `.env.example` and the deployment checklist.
2. Verify each variable is configured in the Vercel project across `Production`, `Preview`, and `Development` environments.
3. Capture screenshots or CLI output (redacting secrets) and store them under `DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_REPORT.md`.
4. Note any missing variables and assign owners to supply the values before the next deployment.:::

## Issue 5: PR workflow requires end-to-end validation
<a id="issue-5-pr-workflow-requires-end-to-end-validation"></a>
[Start Task](#task-issue-5)

### Suggested Tasks

### Task Steps
<a id="task-issue-5"></a>
:::task-stub{title="Prepare reviewed PR back to main"}
1. Push the integration branch and open a PR targeting `main`, attaching the refreshed `.ci/INTEGRATION_REPORT.md`.
2. Assign reviewers, linking to test artifacts and the dependency inventory for faster review.
3. Address review feedback, rerun `npm run test:ci`, and update the report before requesting final approval and merge.:::

<a id="task-issue-5-automation"></a>
:::task-stub{title="Automate reviewer notifications"}
1. Configure a PR template (if not already present) to include checklists for dependency review, conflict log review, and Vercel deployment status.
2. Set up CODEOWNERS or branch protection rules so key reviewers are auto-requested when the integration branch PR opens.
3. Draft a Slack or Teams notification snippet referencing the PR link and key artifacts, and include it in `.ci/INTEGRATION_REPORT.md` for reuse.
4. After automation is in place, note the process in `APPROVALS.md` so the release manager can audit notification coverage.:::
