# Atlas + Supabase (Step 1)
- Ensure `.env.local` has:
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL (public, safe for client)
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (public, safe for client)
  - OPENAI_API_KEY (SERVER-ONLY, never expose as NEXT_PUBLIC_)
  - OPENAI_ROUTER_AGENT_ID (SERVER-ONLY, never expose as NEXT_PUBLIC_)
  - CHATKIT_DOMAIN_KEY (SERVER-ONLY, never expose as NEXT_PUBLIC_)
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`
- Visit `/atlas-check` to verify Atlas UI + Supabase env.
- **Security Note**: Do not expose server-only keys (SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, STRIPE_* secrets, etc.) in client code or with NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix. Use these only in server API routes.
