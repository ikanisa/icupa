# Phase 9 Offline Testing Assets

This directory captures the matrices, logs, and supporting artefacts produced by the outsourced offline QA vendor during Phase 9.

## Expected structure

- `phase9-matrix.xlsx` – Device × network × browser plan referenced in the outsourcing playbook.
- `runs/` – Subdirectories per execution day containing screen recordings, console exports, and Supabase trace IDs.

All files should remain anonymised and omit PII while preserving enough context for the core team to reproduce issues.
